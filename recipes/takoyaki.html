    <h1>Takoyaki</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/takoyaki.webp">
    <h2>A yummy ball snack from Japan!</h2>
    <p>The 1930s saw the creation of takoyaki, which is still renowned as being Osakan food today.
        Octopus is the "tako" in "takoyaki," and "yaki" is baked.
        A ball-shaped snack composed with batter based on wheat,
        and may have a variety of different toppings and fillings.</p>
    <p>The main filling is octopus, as you might have anticipated given that the word tako in takoyaki means octopus! Green onion, pickled ginger, and tempura remnants typically make up the remaining fillings. The takoyaki is then covered with bonito flakes, dried laver, Japanese mayonnaise, and takoyaki sauce, which is quite reminiscent of Worcester sauce.
        But there are several distinct differences!
        For instance, you can find ones with shrimp or other types of seafood inside!</p>
